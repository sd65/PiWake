> What is PiWake ?

PiWake is a comfortable way to view Satelys Calendars. Because you don't need to login anywhere ad what you view is what you gonna go.

> How it works ?

PiWake firs etablish a connection to the SAtelys server to get the VCS files for each week. Then, it parse and push all the information to a SQL database. Third, it just display the calendar.

> Special Thanks

I would like to thanks Simon Talaga for his help !
