> What is PiWake ?

PiWake is a comfortable way to view Satellys Calendars. Because you don't need to login anywhere and what you view is what you gonna go.

> How it works ?

PiWake first etablish a connection to the Satellys server to get the VCS files for each week. Then, it parse and push all the information to a SQL database. Third, it just display the calendar.

> Where can I test it ?
